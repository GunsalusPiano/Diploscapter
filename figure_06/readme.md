# Hypothetical history chromosome evolution
## Model of chromosome fusions and rearrangements
The rearrangement of Nigon domains and PC3 of DpaA PoreC was accomplished by ```Nigon_domain_fragment_coord_translate.py```, by taking the ```Dpac.scaffold_1.genomic_busco_equiv_of_Dpac.scaffold_1.full_table.tsv``` and ```Dpac.scaffold_1.PC3.window100000.increment100000.txt``` from **Fig. 4**. Furthermore, we used two files to define the broad Nigon domains and to specify how to rearrange them.
- ```DpaA_Nigon_domains.txt``` defines the coordinates of Nigon domains, with the start (column 2) and end (column 3) positions. Each domain is also given a name (column 4): here, labelled a-o.
- ```Diploscapter_rearrangement_order_v3.txt``` lists the order of the domains and the orientation.

The reshuffled Nigon painting map and the PC3 were plotted using the R code in ```reshuffled_features_visualizations_2025-12.md```.
