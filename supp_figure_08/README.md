# Quantification of traits within center-like, high frequency contact (HFC) regions

We use the script ```Diploscapter_traits_inside_outisde_HFCs_v4.py``` to extract measurements of
- RE site density
- repeat density
- exonic DNA density
- GC content

within and outside HFC regions. The HFC coordinates are defined in ```DpaA_HFCs.txt```, ```DpaB_HFCs.txt```, ```DcoA_HFCs.txt``` and ```DcoB_HFCs.txt```.
