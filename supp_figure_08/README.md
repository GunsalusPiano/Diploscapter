# Quantification of traits within center-like, high frequency contact (HFC) regions

We use the script ```Diploscapter_traits_inside_outisde_HFCs_v4.py``` to extract measurements of
- RE site density
- repeat density
- exonic DNA density
- GC content

from **Fig. 4**, and classify these as either within or outside HFC regions. The HFC coordinates are defined in ```DpaA_HFCs.txt```, ```DpaB_HFCs.txt```, ```DcoA_HFCs.txt``` and ```DcoB_HFCs.txt```. The results were stored in ```Diploscapter.exons.data.txt```, ```Diploscapter.GC_content.data.txt```, ```Diploscapter.RE.data.txt```, and ```Diploscapter.repeats.data.txt```.
