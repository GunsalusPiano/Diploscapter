# Graphing the occupancy of telomeric repeats at the ends of long sequencing reads

Here, the *Diploscapter* telomeric repeat motif was found using TeloSearchLR ([GitHub](https://github.com/gchchung/TeloSearchLR/), [*G3* publication](https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/15/6/jkaf062/8102967)), which examines long sequencing reads for repeat motifs and their reverse complement motifs enriched at the ends. TeloSearchLR relies on the tandem repeat detection algorithm TideHunter ([Gao & al 2019 *Bioinformatics*](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/14/i200/5529224), [GitHub](https://github.com/Xinglab/TideHunter)).
